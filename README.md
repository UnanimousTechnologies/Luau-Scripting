<h5>1. What is Luau?</h5>
Luau is Robloxâ€™s lightweight, secure, and fast scripting language, derived from Lua. It controls interactivity, game logic, UI behavior, and more in Roblox experiences.
Luau scripts run on both the client and server side, and learning it unlocks 90% of what makes Roblox games function.

2. Setting Up for Scripting
Open Roblox Studio and load a Baseplate template.
Open the Explorer and Properties panels (View > Explorer & View > Properties).
Right-click on Workspace > Insert Object > Script.
This creates a basic server script inside the game world.

3. Your First Script
Replace the default text in the script with the following:
print("Hello, Roblox world!")
